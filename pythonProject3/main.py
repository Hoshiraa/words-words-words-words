Sorry. my reasons are too long to list so I've never talked about it but thanks for everything.
This is one hell of a friend group. This is prolly the first real and genuine friend circle I've been in.
I cry a lot and you guys did too, lmao. Idk what to say, I am out of words.
I guess have a great life. Thank you. You were very fucking important to me. I love you all!!
